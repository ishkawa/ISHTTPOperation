# ISHTTPOperation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ishkawa/ISHTTPOperation.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ishkawa/ISHTTPOperation) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/ishkawa/ISHTTPOperation/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/ishkawa/ISHTTPOperation?branch=master)

a subclass of NSOperation to wrap asynchronous NSURLConnection.

## Requirements

- iOS 4.0 or later
- ARC

## Usage

```objectivec
NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://date.jsontest.com"];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URL];
[ISHTTPOperation sendRequest:request handler:^(NSHTTPURLResponse *response, id object, NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        return;
    }
    // completion
}];
```

the operations made by `sendRequest:handler:` will be enqueued to `[NSOperationQueue defaultHTTPQueue]`.

### Cancel operations

```objectivec
ISHTTPOperationQueue *queue = [ISHTTPOperationQueue defaultQueue];
[queue cancelAllOperations];
```

```objectivec
NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"request.HTTPMethod MATCHES %@", @"GET"];
[queue cancelOperationsUsingPredicate:predicate];
```

```objectivec
[queue cancelOperationsWithHTTPMethod:@"GET"];
[queue cancelOperationsWithHost:@"example.com"];
[queue cancelOperationsWithPath:@"/foo"];
```

## Installing

Add files under `ISHTTPOperation/` to your Xcode project.

### CocoaPods

If you use CocoaPods, you can install ISHTTPOperation by inserting config below.
```
pod 'ISHTTPOperation'
```

## Advanced 

### Manage network indicator visible

observe `operationCount` key of `[ISHTTPOperation sharedQueue]`.

```objectivec
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    NSOperationQueue *queue = [NSOperationQueue defaultHTTPQueue];
    [queue addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"operationCount" options:0 context:NULL];

    ...
}
```

```objectivec
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context
{
    if ([keyPath isEqualToString:@"operationCount"]) {
        UIApplication *application = [UIApplication sharedApplication];
        NSOperationQueue *queue = [NSOperationQueue defaultHTTPQueue];
        application.networkActivityIndicatorVisible = [queue operationCount] ? YES : NO;
    } else {
        [super observeValueForKeyPath:keyPath ofObject:object change:change context:context];
    }
}
```

### Add data processing 

To add data processing to the operation, override `processData:`.  
This method is called in subthread.

ex. JSON parse

```objectivec
- (id)processData:(NSData *)data
{
    NSError *error = nil;
    id object = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data
                                                options:NSJSONReadingAllowFragments
                                                  error:&error];
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@"JSON error: %@", error);
    }
    return object;
}
```
